# Model Maintenance

The `Analysis > Model Maintenance` submenu in the main menubar contains analyses for simplifying, understanding, or otherwise "cleaning up" AADL models.  

## Find Unused Classifiers

The **Find Unused Classifiers** analysis scans one or more AADL package and marks each classifier (component type, component implementation, or feature group) that is never referenced from within the current Eclipse workspace.
