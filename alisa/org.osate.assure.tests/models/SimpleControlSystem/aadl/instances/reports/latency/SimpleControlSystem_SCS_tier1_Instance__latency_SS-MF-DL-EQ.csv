End to end Latency Summary
WARNING,Minimum specified flow latency total 6.00ms less than expected minimum end to end latency 12.0ms (better response time)
WARNING,Minimum actual latency total 6.00ms less than expected minimum end to end latency 12.0ms (faster actual minimum response time)
ERROR,Maximum actual latency total 30.0ms exceeds expected maximum end to end latency 18.0ms
WARNING,Jitter of actual latency total 6.00..30.0ms exceeds expected end to end latency jitter 12.0..18.0ms
